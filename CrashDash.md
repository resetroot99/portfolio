Collision Repair Analytics - Profit Per Job Analyzer

**Live Platform:** https://www.crashman.xyz/

## Overview

CrashDash transforms collision repair shop operations through advanced analytics, CCC ONE integration, and comprehensive profit tracking. The platform provides detailed line-item costing analysis, performance metrics, and real-time dashboards that enable shop owners and managers to understand true profitability at the job level.

## Problem

Collision repair shops struggle to understand true job profitability. While revenue is visible, the actual profit per job remains opaque due to complex factors including parts markup variations, labor rate negotiations, sublet costs, and DRP concessions. Shop owners make business decisions based on revenue rather than profit, leading to acceptance of unprofitable work, inability to identify which estimators or job types generate the best margins, and missed opportunities for operational optimization. Traditional shop management systems focus on workflow and scheduling but provide minimal insight into financial performance at the granular level needed for strategic decisions.

## Solution

CrashDash provides comprehensive profit analysis at the line-item level for every job. The platform integrates directly with CCC ONE estimates, automatically parsing AWF, EMS, and CSV files to extract detailed job data. It calculates true profitability by accounting for parts markup, labor rates, sublet costs, and overhead allocation. Shop owners gain visibility into which jobs, estimators, and repair types generate the best margins, enabling data-driven decisions about DRP participation, pricing strategies, and operational improvements.

## Key Features

The CCC ONE integration automatically uploads and parses estimates with smart field mapping for AWF, EMS, and CSV file formats. This eliminates manual data entry and ensures accurate profit calculations based on actual estimate data.

Profit analysis provides detailed line-item costing with parts markup tracking, labor rate analysis, and margin calculation for every component of every job. Shop owners can see exactly where profit is generated or lost, identifying opportunities to improve margins through better parts sourcing, labor efficiency, or pricing strategies.

Performance analytics track key performance indicators including cycle times, estimator performance, revenue trends, and profitability by repair type. Interactive charts and dashboards provide visual insights into shop operations, enabling quick identification of trends and outliers.

Shop management features include job tracking, delivery schedule monitoring, and real-time shop health dashboards. Managers can oversee all active jobs, identify bottlenecks, and ensure timely completion while maintaining profitability targets.

Team collaboration is enabled through role-based access for managers, estimators, and technicians. Secure team management ensures appropriate visibility into financial data while enabling operational staff to access the information they need for their roles.

Advanced reporting generates comprehensive reports on profitability, job distribution, and operational efficiency. Reports can be customized by time period, estimator, repair type, or insurance company, providing the specific insights needed for strategic planning and performance reviews.

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built with modern web technologies and integrates with CCC ONE through file upload and parsing. Data processing extracts estimate details, calculates costs and margins, and stores results for analysis and reporting. The analytics engine provides real-time calculations and interactive visualizations.

## Live Deployment

**Platform:** https://www.crashman.xyz/  
**Status:** Production - Available for collision repair shops

## Use Cases

Independent collision repair shops use CrashDash to understand true job profitability, negotiate better DRP terms based on data, and identify which types of repairs generate the best margins.

Multi-location collision repair groups track performance across shops, compare estimator effectiveness, and standardize best practices based on profitability data.

Shop owners evaluating DRP participation use CrashDash to calculate the true cost of DRP concessions and make informed decisions about which programs to join or exit.

Estimators use the platform to understand how their work impacts shop profitability and identify opportunities to improve margins through better parts selection or labor time optimization.

## Relationship to CrashCodex

CrashDash focuses on post-estimate profitability analysis, while CrashCodex operates at the estimate creation phase to provide reasoning and guidance. Together, they form a comprehensive intelligence layer for collision repair operations: CrashCodex helps create better estimates through AI-powered reasoning, and CrashDash analyzes results to identify what works best financially.
