# Why TECP Exists

## The Problem

AI systems increasingly process sensitive data through third-party services. Users must trust that:
- Data will not be retained beyond processing
- Processing happens in isolated, ephemeral environments
- No unauthorized access or logging occurs

Current solutions rely on legal agreements, periodic audits, and institutional trust. These mechanisms break under pressure. A single compromised employee, a subpoena, or a business model change can invalidate all promises.

## The Insight

Trust should be cryptographically verifiable, not legally promised. If a system claims data was processed ephemerally, it should be able to prove it mathematically.

## The Solution

TECP provides signed cryptographic receipts that prove:
1. Data entered a verified ephemeral environment
2. Processing occurred under machine-readable privacy policies
3. Data was cryptographically confirmed as deleted
4. All steps are independently verifiable via a public transparency ledger

This transforms "trust us" into "verify this."

## Real-World Impact

- **Healthcare AI:** HIPAA compliance becomes provable, not just documented
- **Financial AI:** SOX requirements are enforced cryptographically
- **Consumer AI:** GDPR "right to deletion" becomes verifiable in real-time

TECP doesn't just make privacy violations harder—it makes them mathematically detectable.
