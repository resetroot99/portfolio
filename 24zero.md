Continuous Cyber Risk Management & Compliance Platform

**Live Platform:** https://24zero.cloud

## Overview

24zero transforms compliance from a yearly checkbox exercise into continuous, automated validation. The platform monitors security controls around the clock, automatically tests their effectiveness, and generates audit-ready evidence while an AI Red Team validates that controls actually work against real attacks.

## Problem

Traditional compliance is fundamentally broken. Point-in-time audits create a false sense of security because they only capture a snapshot of an organization's security posture at a specific moment. By the time the audit report arrives, infrastructure has already evolved with new devices, vulnerabilities, and risks. Organizations spend weeks collecting evidence, passing audits, and then hoping nothing changes until the next annual review. This approach leaves security teams drowning in spreadsheets, screenshots, and manual control testing while providing no assurance that controls actually prevent attacks.

## Solution

24zero provides continuous compliance validation with AI-powered security testing. Unlike traditional GRC tools that merely track whether policies exist on paper, 24zero actively validates security posture by running real attack scenarios against infrastructure. The platform monitors security controls continuously, automatically tests their effectiveness, generates cryptographically signed audit-ready evidence, and uses an AI Red Team to validate that controls can actually stop attackers.

## Key Features

The platform supports seven major compliance frameworks including SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST CSF, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and CIS Controls. Each framework includes complete control libraries with automated testing, evidence collection, and cross-framework mapping to eliminate duplicate work. Organizations can see exactly which controls overlap across frameworks, implement once to satisfy multiple audits, and receive real-time compliance scores with gap analysis.

The AI Red Team runs over fifteen automated attack scenarios covering the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This system continuously tests controls by simulating real-world attacks from credential theft to privilege escalation to data exfiltration. Each finding includes detailed attack narratives showing exactly how an attacker would compromise systems and which controls successfully blocked them. Every finding is validated through actual execution rather than theoretical scanning.

Automated control testing eliminates manual validation work. Organizations can schedule recurring tests for every security control including access controls, encryption, logging, and monitoring. The system provides instant alerts when controls fail, along with detailed remediation guidance and automated ticket creation.

Evidence management is fully automated. Every control test generates timestamped, cryptographically signed evidence that meets audit requirements from day one. Organizations can generate complete audit packages in minutes rather than weeks, export evidence by framework or time period, and share secure links with auditors without exposing entire systems.

Real-time monitoring provides continuous visibility across entire infrastructures. The platform tracks device compliance, policy enforcement, configuration changes, and security events through customizable dashboards. Teams receive instant alerts when devices fall out of compliance, new vulnerabilities are discovered, or suspicious activity is detected, with the ability to drill down from high-level dashboards to individual device telemetry.

Enterprise-grade multi-tenancy with fine-grained role-based access control enables management of multiple organizations, teams, and compliance programs from a single platform with complete data isolation. Organizations can define custom roles and permissions for auditors, security teams, and executives, integrate SSO with Google and GitHub, and maintain complete audit trails for every user action and system change.

## Technical Architecture

The platform combines automated control testing, AI-powered security validation, and real-time monitoring. The AI Red Team uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework to simulate realistic attack scenarios, validating that security controls can actually prevent breaches rather than just existing on paper. Evidence collection uses cryptographic signatures to ensure audit trail integrity and tamper-proof compliance records.

## Use Cases

Financial services organizations use 24zero to meet SOC 2, PCI DSS, and banking regulations with continuous validation, automated evidence collection for SOX compliance, and real-time monitoring of access controls and data protection measures.

Healthcare providers achieve and maintain HIPAA compliance with automated control testing, tracking of PHI access, encryption, and audit logging across entire infrastructures, with the ability to generate audit packages in minutes.

Technology and SaaS companies accelerate SOC 2 certification and maintain continuous compliance through automated evidence collection, AI-powered security validation, and real-time dashboards accessible to both customers and auditors.

Government and defense organizations meet NIST CSF, FedRAMP, and CMMC requirements with comprehensive control testing, complete audit trails, and cryptographic evidence validation for high-assurance environments.

E-commerce and retail businesses maintain PCI DSS compliance with automated quarterly scans and continuous monitoring, tracking cardholder data flows, encryption, and access controls across payment infrastructure.

## Pricing

The platform offers a free tier with basic compliance monitoring for one framework and up to five devices. Paid tiers range from nine dollars per month for startups to custom enterprise pricing, with features including AI Red Team validation, multi-framework support, and unlimited devices for large organizations.
