# AI-LA Framework (WordPress)

WordPress Integration for Autonomous AI Development

## Overview

AI-LA Framework for WordPress extends the AI-LA autonomous development system to work seamlessly with WordPress sites. The framework enables natural language-driven WordPress development, from theme customization to plugin generation and content management automation.

## Problem

WordPress development typically requires deep knowledge of PHP, WordPress hooks, template hierarchy, and plugin architecture. Non-technical users struggle to customize sites beyond basic theme options, while developers spend significant time on repetitive customization tasks.

## Solution

AI-LA Framework for WordPress provides natural language interfaces for WordPress development tasks. Users describe what they want in plain English, and the system generates production-ready WordPress code including themes, plugins, custom post types, and automation workflows.

## Key Features

The framework handles theme generation and customization, automatically creating child themes with custom templates, styles, and functionality. It generates WordPress plugins from natural language descriptions, including proper hook integration, admin interfaces, and security best practices. The system creates custom post types and taxonomies with appropriate meta boxes and admin UI. Content management automation includes bulk operations, scheduled tasks, and workflow automation.

## Technical Architecture

The system is built on PHP for WordPress core integration, with JavaScript and React for modern admin interfaces. It uses the WordPress REST API for external integrations and implements OpenAI API integration for code generation. The architecture includes a WordPress plugin core that provides the AI integration layer, a code generation engine that produces WordPress-compliant code, a validation layer ensuring security and best practices, and a deployment system for automatic activation and testing.

## Use Cases

Agencies can rapidly prototype client sites with custom functionality. Content teams can automate repetitive WordPress tasks without developer intervention. Developers can scaffold plugins and themes from specifications, and non-technical users can extend WordPress functionality through natural language.

## Integration

The framework installs as a WordPress plugin, integrates with existing themes and plugins, and provides both admin UI and WP-CLI interfaces. It supports multisite installations for enterprise deployments.
